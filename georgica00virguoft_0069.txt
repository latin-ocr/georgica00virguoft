Although the great improvements in the Printing Art have
done so much to add to the appearance of Books, and also to di-
minish the cest, yet the price still fin-ms rather a serious item in
the expense of education. This is particularly the case in editions
of the Greek and Latin Classics. There is no want of excellence
in many of these, but they are generally either so comprehensive
or so extended by annotations, that the price is an obstacle to
those who, entertaining enlarged views of the advantages of edu-
cation, have not means commensurate with their wishes. It is,
therefore, the intention of the Subscribers, to publish neat and
correct editions of such detached portions of the Classic authors
as are usually read in Schools and Colleges. This plan has been
tried in England, and has been attended with marked success.

To those who are obliged to study eeonomy in education, these
editions will be recommended by their cheapness, their accuracy
and their being limited in their extent to that which is absolutely
necessat· n

To thiwse, who either possess, or can afford to possess more,
expensive editions, these little copies will be offered as a means
of saving the others from that speedy inj ury or destruction which
befals books in the daily transit between home and school. They
will be more portable and convenient, more fair and scholarlike
in the class—room--not open to the just and reasonable objection
which Tutors make to editions so charged with noteS, that they
almost amount to a translation.

Some years ago, the Subscribers made the attempt to introduce
a uniform series of Books into the Common Schools of Canada.
Their design was heartily seconded by the Board of Education
in Ireland‚ who promptly and with the utmost liberality placed
the copyright of their valuable Text Books at their disposal. At
a very considerable expense of labour and money, the Subscri-
bers, in a shorter period than they anticipated‚ succeeded in intro-
ducing the Books into almost every section of the Province.
Since then the indefatigable and intelligent Superinteudent of
Education in Canada West. who, at an early period, expressed
to the Subscribers his favourable opinion of these Books, having
himself obtained permission to reprint them, delegated the
right to other Booksellers in Canada, by whom, and by the Sub-
scribers, under their original grant from the Irish Board‚ the Pro-
vince is now abundantly supplied with these excellent Books.

The success which attended this experimcnt to improve and
render uniform the Books used in the Common Schools of Canada,
has emboldened the Subscribers to undertake the publication of
